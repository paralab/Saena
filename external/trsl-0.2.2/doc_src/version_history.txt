/**
 * @defgroup version_history Version History
 *
 * @section version_history_v022 Version 0.2.2
 *
 * - Added TRSL_VERSION_NR.
 *
 * - Renamed trsl::is_picked_systematic::isFirstPick to
 *   trsl::is_picked_systematic::is_first_pick.
 *
 * - Added trsl::is_first_pick to avoid awkward statements like <tt>i.predicate().is_first_pick(*i)</tt>.
 *
 * - Added <tt>index()</tt> to trsl::reorder_iterator.
 *
 * - Added <tt>index()</tt> to trsl::ppfilter_iterator.
 *
 * - Changed "double quotes" include directives to use angle brackets
     instead.
 *
 * - Removed unnecessary include of
 *   trsl/persistent_filter_iterator.hpp from
 *   trsl/is_picked_systematic.hpp.
 *
 * - For systematic sampling, trsl::ppfilter_iterator should be used
 *   by default, and trsl::persistent_filter_iterator should be used
 *   only when it is guaranteed that the order in which the input
 *   population is presented is not following any pattern. To
 *   encourage this policy, trsl::persistent_filter_iterator has been
 *   replace by trsl::ppfilter_iterator in the following examples:
 *   examples/trsl_example1.cpp, examples/trsl_example1plus.cpp,
 *   examples/ParticleCollection.cpp. Naturally, <tt>std::list</tt> had to be replaced
 *   with <tt>std::vector</tt> in examples/trsl_example1.cpp.
 *
 * - Enhanced documentation.
 *
 * @section version_history_v021 Version 0.2.1
 *
 * - Removed <tt>const</tt> on @p predicate_ in
 *   trsl::ppfilter_iterator, to allow iterator assignment with
 *   <tt>operator=</tt>.
 *
 * - Added <tt>isFirstPick()</tt> to trsl::is_picked_systematic.
 *
 * @section version_history_v020 Version 0.2.0
 *
 * - Restored default constructor in trsl::random_permutation_iterator
 *   (trsl::random_permutation_iterator has been renamed
 *   trsl::reorder_iterator, see below).
 *
 * - Pulled trsl::reorder_iterator out of the old
 *   trsl::random_permutation_iterator.  Added trsl::sort_iterator.
 *
 * - trsl::random_permutation_iterator uses a partial shuffle
 *   algorithm instead of std::random_shuffle. It is thus efficient to
 *   iterate over a permutation of a subset that is much smaller than
 *   the population.
 *
 * - Fixed <tt>operator==</tt> bug in
 *   trsl::persistent_filter_iterator. Two
 *   trsl::persistent_filter_iterator are now equal if their base
 *   iterators are equal <em>and</em> if their predicates are equal.
 *
 * - Added a default constructor to trsl::is_picked_systematic. Note
 *   that a default-constructed trsl::is_picked_systematic is invalid.
 *
 * - Added trsl::ppfilter_iterator.
 *
 * @section version_history_v011 Version 0.1.1
 *
 * Changes made to the code are:
 *
 * -
 * trsl::random_permutation_iterator::random_permutation_iterator(ElementIterator,ElementIterator,index_t)
 * now checks that the permutation size is smaller or equal to the
 * population size, and throws an exception if it is not the case.
 * 
 * - trsl/error_handling.hpp: TRSL exceptions.
 *
 * - trsl/common.hpp: random number wrappers.
 *
 * - trsl::is_picked_systematic and trsl::random_permutation_iterator
 *   are now using functions from trsl/common.hpp.
 *   trsl::random_permutation_iterator was previously using the random
 *   generator built in <tt>std::random_shuffle</tt>, which is usually
 *   <tt>rand</tt>. trsl::is_picked_systematic was using
 *   <tt>random</tt>. Both will now use <tt>rand</tt> by default, and
 *   <tt>random</tt> if TRSL_USE_BSD_BETTER_RANDOM_GENERATOR is
 *   defined. See @ref random for more details.
 *
 * - trsl::is_picked_systematic is now explicitly handling the case @p
 *   sampleSize==0.
 *
 * - Removed default constructor in trsl::random_permutation_iterator.
 *
 * This release also features many documentation fixes
 * (corrections, rephrasing and additions).
 *
 * @section version_history_v010 Version 0.1.0
 *
 * Begins with trsl::is_picked_systematic,
 * trsl::persistent_filter_iterator,
 * trsl::random_permutation_iterator.
 *
