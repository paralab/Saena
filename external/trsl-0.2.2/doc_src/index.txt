 * TRSL is a C++ library that implements several sampling schemes
 * behind an (STL-like) iterator interface. The library may be used
 * e.g. in particle filtering or probabilistic inference frameworks.
 * For an overview of the functionalities provided by TRSL, refer to
 * the @ref products page.

 * TRSL is meant to be OS Portable. It has been tested on Linux and MacOS X with
 * GCC 4 and LLVM 2.8 (with clang). If anyone tries it with a
 * different compiler/platform, <a

 *
 * @section index_products Products
 *
 * See the @ref products page for the complete list of functionalities
 * offered by TRSL.
 *
 * The central TRSL product is trsl::is_picked_systematic, a predicate
 * functor to use in combination with trsl::persistent_filter_iterator
 * to form a <em>sample iterator</em>.  The sample iterator accesses a
 * population of elements through a range defined by a pair of Forward
 * Iterators (begin/end), and provides on-the-fly iteration through a
 * sample of the population.
 *
 * Let us assume a particle filter implementation, which manages a
 * population of particles (<tt>struct Particle { weight; x; y;
 * }</tt>) stored in a container <tt>ParticleCollection</tt>. The following
 * bit of code shows an example of how to iterate through a sample of
 * the population after having implemented
 * <tt>ParticleCollection::sample_begin(size_t)</tt> and
 * <tt>ParticleCollection::sample_end()</tt> using
 * e.g. trsl::is_picked_systematic.
