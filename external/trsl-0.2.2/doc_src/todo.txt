 * @defgroup todo To Do List
 *
 * <!--@section todo_short_term Short Term-->
 * 
 * @section todo_long_term Long Term
 * 
 * - Add debug stubs. One good thing to check for would be that
 * is_picked_systematic doesn't return more elements than requested,
 * and that it has returned the exact number of elements upon
 * destruction.  This will call for an extra bool <em>beenCalled</em>
 * to prevent errors in temporary instantiations of
 * is_picked_systematic.
 * 
 * - Add a module for boost::filter_iterator explanation
 * (e.g. interoperability, constness, etc...).
 *
 * - Allow passing a RandomNumberGenerator to the constructor of
 * trsl::random_permutation_iterator.
 *
 * - Write an importance_sample_iterator.
 *
 *
 * @section todo_open_questions Open Questions
