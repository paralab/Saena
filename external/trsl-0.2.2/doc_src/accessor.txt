 * @defgroup accessor Accessors
 *
 * Accessors are usually called at least once for each element of the
 * accessed collection. Hence, they should be designed carefully in
 * every situation where performance is an issue. For example, one can
 * gain a lot by having the compiler inline accessors.
 * 
 * @section accessor_accessor_types Accessor Types
 * 
 * This section describes different types of accessor.
 * In the following, we assume elements to be <tt>Particle</tt>s.
 * @code
 * class Particle
 * {
 * public:
 *   Particle(double weight, double x, double y) :
 *     x_(x), y_(y), weight_(weight) {}
 *   
 *   void setWeight(const double weight) { weight_ = weight; }
 *   double getWeight() const { return weight_; };
 * 
 * private:
 *   double x_;
 *   double y_;
 *   double weight_;
 * };
 * @endcode
 * 
 * @subsection accessor_functor Functor
 * 
 * @code
 * struct functor_weight_accessor {
 *   double operator() (const Particle& p) const
 *   { return p.getWeight(); }
 * };
 * @endcode
 * 
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Accessor Type</dt>
 * <dd><tt>functor_weight_accessor</tt></dd>
 * <dt>Accessor object, to pass to the object that needs access</dt>
 * <dd><tt>functor_weight_accessor()</tt></dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * An example of functor accessor is trsl::weight_accessor, which
 * always returns 1 &mdash; useful if elements have uniform weights.
 * 
 * @subsection accessor_functionpointer Function Pointer
 * 
 * @code
 * double function_pointer_weight_accessor(const Particle& p)
 * { return p.getWeight(); }
 * @endcode
 * 
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Accessor Type</dt>
 * <dd><tt>std::pointer_to_unary_function<const Particle&, double></tt></dd>
 * <dt>Accessor object, to pass to the object that needs access</dt>
 * <dd><tt>std::ptr_fun(function_pointer_weight_accessor)</tt></dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * @subsection accessor_methodpointer Method Pointer
 * 
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Accessor Type</dt>
 * <dd><tt>std::const_mem_fun_ref_t<double, Particle></tt></dd>
 * <dt>Accessor object, to pass to the object that needs access</dt>
 * <dd><tt>std::mem_fun_ref(&Particle::getWeight)</tt></dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * Method pointer is currently the default in
 * trsl::is_picked_systematic (but subject to change, see @ref
 * accessor_discussion).  The implementation used in TRSL is not
 * std::const_mem_fun_ref_t however, but trsl::mp_weight_accessor
 * which allows a default construction without implying segfault when
 * called &mdash; that comes with a price, see
 * trsl::mp_weight_accessor.
 * 
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Accessor Type</dt>
 * <dd><tt>trsl::mp_weight_accessor<double, Particle></tt></dd>
 * <dt>Accessor object, to pass to the object that needs access</dt>
 * <dd><tt>&Particle::getWeight</tt> (implicit conversion)</dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * The pointer to <tt>getWeight</tt> implicitly constructs a
 * trsl::mp_weight_accessor. (Why does the std counterpart have an
 * explicit constructor?)
 * 
 * @section accessor_discussion Discussion
 * 
 * I had the impression that GCC was able to inline fuctions
 * from pointers. Performance tests on accessors (see
 * <tt>tests/accessor_efficiency.cpp</tt>) tend to contradict this
 * impression. With <tt>-03</tt> optimization, the functor accessor is
 * twice as fast as other accessors. Please comment if you know more
 * about this.
