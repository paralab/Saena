abstract="Intel Xeon Phi is a recently released high-performance coprocessor which features 61 cores each supporting 4 hardware threads with 512-bit wide SIMD registers achieving a peak theoretical performance of 1Tflop/s in double precision. Its design differs from classical modern processors; it comes with a large number of cores, the 4-way hyperthreading capability allows many applications to saturate the massive memory bandwidth, and its large SIMD capabilities allow to reach high computation throughput. The core of many scientific applications involves the multiplication of a large, sparse matrix with a single or multiple dense vectors which are not compute-bound but memory-bound. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the Xeon Phi coprocessor for these sparse linear algebra kernels. We highlight the important hardware details and show that Xeon Phi's sparse kernel performance is very promising and even better than that of cutting-edge CPUs and GPUs.",
